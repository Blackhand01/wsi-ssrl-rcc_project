The resulting `.parquet` file is used as input for the training phase. The notebook performs the following steps:\n","\n","1. **Load the configuration** from `preprocessing.yaml`, resolving environment paths and parameters.\n","2. **Select the active stage** (`debug` or `training`) and extract patching/sampling parameters (patch size, stride, seed, patients per class).\n","3. **Load and filter the metadata**, keeping only entries with valid XML annotations or ROI files.\n","4. **Optionally downsample patients**, selecting a subset per class if sampling is enabled.\n","5. **Build reusable ROI maps** for each subtype, mapping patients to annotated areas (either XML or ROI).\n","6. **Split patients into train/val/test**, based on configured proportions and a random seed.\n","7. **Sample patches per subtype and split**, ensuring balanced class distribution and extracting spatial coordinates within annotated areas.\n","8. **Build and export the patch DataFrame**, saving it as a `.parquet` file inside a uniquely versioned dataset folder.\n","9. **Log metadata and register the dataset**, writing a version descriptor `.md` and updating a central CSV registry.\n","10. **Run integrity checks**, including patch counts per class/split, duplicated patient IDs, and subtype overlaps.\n","11. **Summarize used WSIs**, printing dimensions and file sizes to ensure correctness.\n","\n","---\n","\n","| #  | **Section (Markdown Title)** | **Main Content (Documented
